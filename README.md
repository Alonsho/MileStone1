**Milestone desctption:** The main concept of this project is to send commands to a flight simulator (client to server), while receiving flight information from it, simultaniously  (also client to server, in the opposite direction).
Particularly, the prgram parses a text file, which contains a code in a made up programming language (instructions were given in advance), with flight instructions, and eventually sends it to the simulator server.


**An important remark:** As written above, this project is in the making.  For now, only the first part of the whole project is complete. All of the description above relates to the current milestone.
